# TwitchBot
This was made based off the TwitchBot created by Cakez77.

It is a text to speech twitch bot.

You will have to set up your twitch user / access token in the config.ini file.

It will randomly select voices for users currently.

Example:

TwitchUserId=Asmongold
TwitchAccessToken=asdfasdfasdfasdf
