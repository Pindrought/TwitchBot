# TwitchBot
This was inspired from the TwitchBot created by Cakez77.

It is a text to speech twitch bot.

You will have to set up your twitch user / access token in the config.ini file.

If a config.ini does not exist, one will be auto generated.

An access token must be generated.
I used this to generate my access token. https://twitchtokengenerator.com/
